# Coding Challenges
 Some random coding problems I discover and solve on my own.
 <br><br>
 Most of these problems were discovered from random sources on the Internet, sometimes even on places like TikTok. My solutions are by no means optimized, and I'll probably do so some time later in the future.

 Feel free to add issues or create pull requests for your own solutions if you wish.
